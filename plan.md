# heff-skills — improvement plan

Living plan for **after-hours-loop**: a drop-in, **workflow-agnostic AFK orchestrator** — install once, point at any agent-ready tracker, walk away. Shape **heff-skills** like mature public skill repos (structure/UX only; do not copy their skill text).

**Status:** **Alpha** (`0.1.0-alpha.2`) — Phase 5 done; Phase 6 companions + packaging hygiene; remaining: outcome depth / harness / audit

## 1. North star

Ship a skill pack where someone can:

1. Install into any Cursor (Agent Skills–compatible) host in under a minute.
2. Point after-hours at **any** trackable inbox of agent-ready work (issues, TODOs, specs, tickets, maps, future non-code queues).
3. Walk away — the loop picks work, runs **A→Z** within the chosen executor, stops safely, leaves a morning brief.

**Positioning:** after-hours is the **AFK loop itself**, not a leaf under grill → tickets. Workflows (Matt, Linear, custom Markdown, research packs, …) are **optional peers** that may produce ready work. We stay Matt-**compatible** (detect/consume their artifacts) without requiring that pipeline or living inside it.

**Direction:** keep code/PR executors excellent for v1, then grow sources + executors beyond code-agent flows (research synthesis, docs, triage digests, ops checklists) while the orchestrator stays stable.

## 2. What research told us

### 2.1 Emulate from [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)

| Pattern | Takeaway for us |
|---------|-----------------|
| Productized distribution | `skills/` SoT + INSTALL hierarchy (README 60s → INSTALL.md deep) |
| `npx skills add … -a cursor` | Match registry layout so Cursor installs without bespoke paths |
| Activation tiers | Opt-in skill / thin `--with-init` pointer — **never** always-on overnight hooks by default |
| Progressive disclosure | Thin `SKILL.md` + `references/` |
| Sibling loop-factory | Ready gate, batch limits, empty-queue noop, run artifacts, autonomy contract |

Also note Julius ships a separate [`loop-factory`](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/skills/tree/main/skills/loop-factory) (inbox → active → archive). Study that shape for queue maturity; do not copy content.

**Don't:** 30-agent installer on day one; hand-maintained duplicate trees; metrics theater without harness.

### 2.2 Emulate from [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)

| Pattern | Takeaway for us |
|---------|-----------------|
| Thin adapters, one behavior source | One `skills/after-hours-loop/`; generate drop-in |
| Persistence / boundaries / stop | Re-anchor rules every tick; clear stop severity |
| Soft-fail optional tooling | Missing ponytail/hooks → continue with fallbacks |
| Deferred-work ledger | Blocked items must not vanish overnight |
| `after-install.md` + uninstall | Residual state (sentinel, state JSON) needs cleanup docs |
| Drift tests | If we mirror adapters, CI sync — or don't pretend |

**Don't:** multi-marketplace sprawl; mandatory peer skills; README as only portability map.

### 2.3 Compose with [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

**Doctrine we adopt (structure):**

- User-invoked orchestrators vs model-invoked primitives; AHL is user/automation-invoked.
- Hard vs soft deps: soft = “if CONTEXT/ADRs/tracker docs exist”; hard = “items must already be agent-ready.”
- Main build chain we sit under:

```text
[optional] wayfinder (plan fog) / triage (incoming)
        → grill-with-docs | grill-me
        → to-spec → to-tickets
        → ★ after-hours-loop (AFK multi-ticket implement)
        → morning brief → human review
```

**Interfaces to consume (not reinvent):**

| Artifact | From | AHL behavior |
|----------|------|--------------|
| `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` | grill-with-docs / domain-modeling | Soft-read every tick; never rewrite overnight |
| Chat-only alignment | grill-me | Stateless — **no file to consume**; user must convert via to-spec/tickets **before** AFK |
| Map + `wayfinder:*` tickets | wayfinder | Build only when map clear *or* Sources opt into `wayfinder-afk` (research / AFK task only — never HITL grilling/prototype overnight) |
| `ready-for-agent` + Agent Brief | triage / to-tickets | Primary GitHub queue; prefer Brief over raw body |
| `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` | setup-matt-pocock-skills | Prefer its ops; don't invent a second dialect |
| Handoff temp file | handoff | Fine for human↔human; AHL morning brief is **durable in-repo** (pointers > dumps) |

**Hard rule:** no interactive grilling, no answering HITL wayfinder tickets, no inventing product decisions during ticks.

### 2.4 Local audit verdict

Orchestration model (sources → queue → executors → PRs + state JSON) is **worth keeping**. Runtime contract is still a **cosmic-themes-starter export**: absolute paths, `dev`/pnpm/B3 hardcodes, mandatory non-bundled skills, identical `skill/` ↔ `drop-in/` twins, thin morning handoff, weak portable safety/stop policy.

```

Migrate from today's `after-hours-loop/skill` + `after-hours-loop/drop-in` into `skills/after-hours-loop` + generated `drop-in/`.

### 3.2 Startup cycle (maturity parity)

| Phase | Human? | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **0. Install** | Yes | `npx skills add` or `install.sh` / copy; LICENSE + gitignore state + morning brief path |
| **1. Setup** | Yes once | Config: repo, baseBranch, testCommand, packageManager; soft-detect Matt setup / ponytail |
| **2. Align** | Yes (optional) | Prefer existing grill-with-docs / wayfinder / to-tickets; else require pre-approved Sources |
| **3. Arm / preflight** | Yes | Validate: `gh` auth, clean tree, base branch, sources non-empty or explicit allow, state writable; **dry-run** prints queue |
| **4. Tick loop** | No | Refresh → pick agent-ready → execute → outcome adapter → persist; soft-read CONTEXT/ADRs |

| **5. Stop** | Auto | empty / maxPrs / consecutive-blocked / dirty-tree / hard safety / user stop |
| **6. Morning** | Yes | Write `.cursor/after-hours-morning-brief.md` (PRs, blocked, residual risk, “grill tomorrow”); kill sentinel docs |

### 3.3 Compatibility contract (draft → implement in `references/compatibility.md`)

**Detect order**

1. `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` → use tracker ops.
2. `ready-for-agent` issues (+ Agent Brief) → primary queue.
3. to-tickets frontier (GitHub deps or `.scratch/…/issues`) when Sources enable it.
4. Open `wayfinder:map` → ignore for product PRs unless `wayfinder-afk` source; only research/AFK task; mention map in morning brief.
5. `CONTEXT.md` / `docs/adr/` → soft constraints.
6. Native `todo-md` / `feature-spec` as today.

**Fallback if Matt absent:** only labeled / checked / named Sources; vague items → `blocked`, never invent scope.

**Soft deps:** ponytail, implement, tdd, code-review — “if present, use; else executor-local steps.”

### 3.4 AFK readiness bar

- [x] Zero personal absolute paths in published docs
- [x] Portable `config.example.json` (repo, baseBranch, testCommand, packageManager, safety paths)
- [x] Cursor install path(s) documented; skills-registry-ready `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- [x] Single SoT + generated drop-in
- [x] Validated state schema + resume + dry-run *(schema docs + `scripts/validate-state.py`)*
- [x] Preflight fail-closed *(prompt contract)*
- [x] Stop severity: skip / block / stop loop / escalate *(vocab + consecutive-blocked / CI-red cascades)*
- [x] Morning brief always written on stop *(prompt contract)*
- [x] Draft PRs by default overnight; path denylist; secrets/auth hard stops *(create-time + post-open isDraft verify)*
- [x] Works without ponytail and without Matt skills *(soft deps)*
- [x] Compatible *with* Matt when installed (same `ready-for-agent` language)
- [x] LICENSE + uninstall / residual-state docs
- [x] `/loop` vs Automation runners documented with same bootstrap syntax *(plus `/after-hours`)*

---

## 4. Implementation phases

### Phase 0 — Plan & research ✅

- [x] Research swarms (caveman, ponytail, mattpocock, local audit)
- [x] Fold findings into this plan
- [x] Lock layout: `skills/` SoT + generated `drop-in/`
- [x] Lock positioning: workflow-agnostic AFK + Cursor-first packaging

### Phase 1 — Repo hygiene & packaging ✅

- [x] Add root `LICENSE`, rewrite `README.md`, draft `INSTALL.md` + `SECURITY.md`
- [x] Move canonical skill to `skills/after-hours-loop/` (legacy `after-hours-loop/` removed)
- [x] Strip cosmic-themes / absolute paths / mandatory peer skill reads
- [x] Add `templates/config.example.json` + parameterize `baseBranch` / `repo` / `testCommand`
- [x] `scripts/sync-drop-in.sh` + `scripts/install.sh` (Cursor-first; dry-run; uninstall notes)
- [x] Enrich frontmatter: triggers + `disable-model-invocation: true`; primary slash **`/after-hours`**
- [x] Generated `drop-in/` from SoT via sync script
- [x] Post-phase audit vs caveman/ponytail/mattpocock ([audit](5925cc8b-83e3-4ada-aed7-bf0c4f5d3273)); fixed soft-fails (config link, pnpm default, drop-in doc pointer, `references/` stubs)

**Audit residual → Phase 2:** fill `references/*`, morning-brief template, readiness/compatibility contracts, preflight; CI drift gate later.

### Phase 2 — Startup + compatibility + handoff ✅

- [x] `references/readiness.md` + `compatibility.md` (+ guardrails, bootstrap, state-schema, morning-brief)
- [x] Preflight checklist in bootstrap; dry-run mode (`/after-hours --dry-run`)
- [x] `morning-brief` template + always write on stop (in-repo, pointers > dumps)
- [x] github-issues source: prefer Agent Brief comments
- [x] Opt-in `sources/wayfinder-afk.md` + `executors/research-only.md`
- [x] Soft-deps wording (ADR-0001 style) in SKILL + compatibility
- [x] Phase-1 residual: thin SKILL → references, drop-in sync CI (`check-drop-in-sync.sh` + workflow), `docs/composition.md`
- [x] Post-phase-2 structure audit ([audit](ae706577-6cae-4366-8e66-3c111daee94c)); fixed pack links, `prs` schema, wayfinder fallback, `allowEmptyQueue`, thin SKILL + `tick-and-runners.md`
### Phase 3 — AFK loop completeness ✅

- [x] Harden stop policy (consecutive-blocked, dirty-tree, CI-red cascade)
- [x] Deepen self-contained executor fallback (Safety checklist on pr-slice / feature-build)
- [x] Portable denylist enforcement notes + draft-PR verification
- [x] Resume mid-queue docs + `scripts/validate-state.py` (also under skill `scripts/`)
- [x] Optional `research-only` executor *(shipped Phase 2)*
- [x] Automation multi-item vs `/loop` interval *(tick-and-runners.md)*
- [x] Post-phase-3 structure audit ([audit](73b45955-2172-4434-b4f2-b72d3d04242c)); fixed composition pack links, morning-brief `ci-red`, prs-object wording, research-only safety checklist

### Phase 4 — Polish & distribute ✅

- [x] `docs/composition.md` *(shipped Phase 2; also skill-local copy)*
- [x] `docs/portability.md` *(shipped Phase 1)*
- [x] `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased + 0.1.0-alpha.1) + root `VERSION` (`0.1.0-alpha.1`)

- [x] Document primary install: `npx skills add jjheffernan/heff-skills -a cursor`; clone + `./scripts/install.sh` as alternative; note release tag `v0.1.0`
- [x] Minimal validate-state fixtures under `skills/after-hours-loop/fixtures/` (+ skill README pointer)
- [x] Example kickoff prompts + night Sources templates + `docs/first-night.md`
- [x] Optional thin Cursor rule template (`cursor-rule.after-hours-loop.mdc.example`)
- [x] Opt-in `sources/github-tickets.md` (to-tickets frontier)
- [x] Post-phase-4 structure audit ([audit](bda1c157-e503-4961-8d80-f4222491c659)); followed up: CHANGELOG/plan honesty, research-only `isDraft`, Sources/architecture/frontmatter consistency
- [x] Smoke CI for validate-state fixtures (valid → 0, invalid → nonzero)
- [ ] Create git tag `v0.1.0` *(cut at publish after push is green)*
- [ ] Fixtures for parse / priority / write-back (stretch beyond validate-state samples)

## 5. Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-07-13 | Living `plan.md` before large refactors | Research → phases → AFK bar |
| 2026-07-13 | Emulate caveman/ponytail **packaging**; compose with mattpocock | Unique AHL; reuse ecosystem |
| 2026-07-13 | No interactive grilling mid-tick | Unattended safety |
| 2026-07-13 | **Cursor-first** install; multi-host matrix later | Avoid ponytail-scale adapter sprawl |
| 2026-07-13 | Canonical path: `skills/after-hours-loop/`; **generate** drop-in | End dual-edit drift |
| 2026-07-13 | Default base branch: **configurable**, example `main`; document `dev` as adapter | Portability |
| 2026-07-13 | AHL remains **user/automation-invoked** orchestrator | Matches Matt user-invoked pattern; model doesn't autodrain overnight |
| 2026-07-13 | Publish via skills registry after Phase 1 packaging stabilizes | SoT layout first |
| 2026-07-13 | Night Sources: optional committed template + nightly paste still OK | Bridge “set and forget” vs flexibility |
| 2026-07-13 | Draft PRs by default for overnight | Safer morning review |
| 2026-07-13 | Primary slash **`/after-hours`** (`name: after-hours`); `/loop` still supported | User-requested trigger; install path stays `after-hours-loop/` |

| 2026-07-13 | Ship `github-tickets` + `wayfinder-afk` in 0.1 (opt-in Sources) | Matt frontier + AFK research coverage without default noise |
| 2026-07-13 | Defer git tag `v0.1.0` until Phase 4 commit + push | Avoid tagging an incomplete tree |
| 2026-07-13 | Reposition: workflow-agnostic AFK; Matt is optional peer, not parent | Avoid locking growth to grill→ticket; enable non-code executors |
| 2026-07-13 | Ship as **alpha** (`0.1.0-alpha.1`); defer `v0.1.0` tag | Multiple real runs before release |
| 2026-07-13 | Treat Cursor Automation as first-class (cron after office hours) | AFK when IDE is closed; document cloud state gap |
| 2026-07-13 | Mega-PR is dual-token per arm only; never config-sticky | Throughput option without accidental PR bundling |

### Still open (non-blocking)

1. Exact morning brief path sticky issue vs `.cursor/` file — currently config `morningBriefPath`
2. ~~Companion micro-skills~~ — **shipped** `after-hours-stop` / `after-hours-handoff` via `--with-companions`
3. Parse/priority/write-back **runnable** fixture harness (docs stubs exist; priority enum deferred)
4. First non-code executor + outcome shape — **shipped:** `docs-digest` + `ops-checklist` + live adapters
5. Dogfood scorecard ingest → promote into next phase; Slack Automation; tag `v0.1.0`

---

## 6. Findings log (condensed)

### Caveman

Distribution machine: SoT `skills/`, INSTALL matrix, activation tiers, CI mirrors, integrity. AFK lesson via **loop-factory** sibling: ready-only work, batch limits, empty noop, run logs. heff should productize install + adapters + ready/stop/handoff — not a 30-agent installer.

### Ponytail

Thin adapters + one behavior source; persistence/stop maturity; soft-fail; deferred ledger; uninstall residual state. AFK borrows activation hygiene; heff already leads on queue/state/PR budget. Soft-require ponytail; don't gate Cursor AFK on Claude hooks.

### mattpocock/skills

Composable gate-heavy startup ending at labeled, briefed, frontier tickets. Treat as **optional inputs**: detect artifacts, prefer briefs/maps/tickets when named in Sources, degrade to any other ready tracker — never require grill/HITL overnight, never sit as a fixed leaf under that chain. Adopt readiness vocabulary: frontier, claim, agent-ready, brief, blocked, handoff, fog.

### Local after-hours-loop

Keep sources × executors × state × dual runners. Fix: portable config, self-contained executor, preflight, stop/handoff/safety, collapse duplication, strip export leftovers. Priority order = Phase 1 → 2 → 3 above.

---

## 7. Immediate next actions → Phase 5

Phases 1–4 shipped the portable AFK coding loop. Next:

### 7.1 Abstraction (workflow-agnostic core)

- [x] Rewrite readiness / composition language everywhere so trackers are **inputs**, not a mandated upstream chain (Matt remains soft-compat docs + opt-in sources).
- [x] Normalize the queue item contract: `id`, `title`, `acceptance`, `blockerPolicy`, `executorHint`, `outcomeKind` — independent of GitHub/PR.
- [x] Separate **outcome adapters** from executors: `draft-pr` (code default) + live `doc-artifact` (`docs-digest`); stubs later: `branch-only`, `report-only`, `external-ticket-update`.

- [x] Keep Sources as the only night-time binding to a workflow; add adapters, don’t fork orchestration.

### 7.2 Beyond code

- [x] Ship one non-code executor MVP (candidate: research/docs digest writing into a repo artifact + morning brief, no PR required).
- [x] Domain-agnostic stop reasons (`done` / `blocked` / `noop` / `budget`) with outcome-specific details in state.
- [x] Document “A→Z” as executor-defined completion, not “opened a PR”.

### 7.3 Matt compatibility (without subordination)

- [x] Keep `wayfinder-afk` + `github-tickets` opt-in; never default them.
- [x] Smoke matrix: Matt artifacts present vs absent vs mixed Sources — same orchestrator path ([docs/smoke-matrix.md](./docs/smoke-matrix.md)).
- [x] Refuse any design that requires grill/to-tickets before `/after-hours` can start.

### 7.4 Hardening / release

- [ ] Tag `v0.1.0` only after multiple alpha dogfood nights (IDE + Automation) score well.
- [ ] Expand fixtures (parse / priority / write-back). *(schema fixtures expanded; parse harness still open)*
- [x] Optional companion micro-skills for stop/handoff if references stay too long. → Phase 6 §8.3 (`after-hours-stop` / `after-hours-handoff`)
- [ ] Ingest first solo night via [docs/first-night-scorecard.md](./docs/first-night-scorecard.md); promote every 0/1 into Phase 5 tickets.
- [x] Cursor Automation office-hours guide + Instructions template ([docs/automation.md](./docs/automation.md))
- [x] Durable cloud ledger (tracked file) so Automation fires share memory without relying on gitignored state — [references/cloud-ledger.md](./skills/after-hours-loop/references/cloud-ledger.md), config `cloudLedgerPath` (default `null`)
- [ ] Optional Slack “fire started / morning summary” action on the Automation *(deferred)*
- [x] Mega-PR mode ([references/mega-pr.md](./skills/after-hours-loop/references/mega-pr.md)) — dual-token every arm; never config-sticky

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Outcomes depth + harness + companions

Phase 5 sealed abstraction. Phase 6 hardens the adapter surface and operator UX without waiting on dogfood or `v0.1.0`.

### 8.1 Live remaining outcome adapters

- [x] Promote `branch-only` from stub → live in `outcomes.md` + executor notes (push `after-hours/…`, no PR; record branch in `notes` / ledger)
- [x] Promote `report-only` → live (morning-brief + chat findings only; no git publish unless human asks)
- [x] Promote `external-ticket-update` → live MVP (`gh issue comment` / tracker comment; no PR required)
- [x] Wire Sources / bootstrap examples for `outcomeKind:` overrides; keep defaults safe (`draft-pr` / `doc-artifact`)

### 8.2 Fixture & parse harness

- [x] Add fixtures (and CI) for: invalid `stopReason`, `megaPr` non-bool, priority enum if validated
- [x] Document parse / priority / write-back expectations in `fixtures/README.md` (harness stubs OK if not runnable yet)
- [x] Keep root ↔ skill ↔ drop-in `validate-state.py` identical

### 8.3 Companion micro-skills (thin)

- [x] Add opt-in companion skills under `skills/`: `after-hours-stop` (kill sentinel / stop phrases / write brief) and `after-hours-handoff` (morning-brief focused) — thin SKILL.md pointing at existing references; **not** always-on
- [x] Document in INSTALL / AGENTS.md / plan; sync drop-in only for `after-hours-loop` (companions install as siblings)
- [x] Update `scripts/sync-drop-in.sh` / install notes if companions should install together (prefer document copy paths; keep sync loop-skill-only unless install.sh already copies all of `skills/`) — companions via `install.sh --with-companions`; **out of drop-in**

### 8.4 Ops / triage beyond-code MVP

- [x] Add `executors/ops-checklist.md` (or `triage-digest.md`): process a checklist / open issues digest → `report-only` or `doc-artifact`; no code PR by default
- [x] Glossary + SKILL modules table + architecture diagram

### 8.5 Packaging hygiene

- [x] Bump `VERSION` → `0.1.0-alpha.2` + CHANGELOG section
- [x] Fix Phase 0 historical checkbox (“downstream AFK of Matt”) → workflow-agnostic wording
- [x] Post-phase-6 structure audit ([audit](6cdf3904-7594-4c14-b79d-ebfbcf4c4491)); janitor soft-fixes; commit + push (no `v0.1.0` tag)

**Deferred (not Phase 6):** dogfood scorecard ingest, Slack Automation action, git tag `v0.1.0`.
